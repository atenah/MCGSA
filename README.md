# MCGSA
This is a document for MCGSA R package to integrate coordinate based geospatial techniques with moving grid method to adjust for environmental variations in high-throughput geo-referenced aerial imagery extracted from UAS and yield data of a large wheat breeding nursery.

Since we georeferenc the UAS imagery and can extract Latitude and Longitude coordinate for each pixel in the images, and correspondingly the center for each plot, we can locate the neighbor plots based on the coordinates of each plot extracted from UAS imagery and not based on the row and column information (traditional method of moving grid). We also can develop the search window not based on the number of neighbors, but based on the distance between each plot and its neighboring plots using a user defined radius. This makes a "circular" moving window search available for the user. These modifications enable us to evaluate the benefits of a less restrictive experimental design in comparison with the traditional row-column designs in breeding programs
